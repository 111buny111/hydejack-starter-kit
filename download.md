There are two versions of **Hydejack**: The *Free version* includes basic blogging functionality and most of Hydejack's [Features], such as dynamic page loading and advanced animations.

The *PRO version* includes additional features for professionals, such as a [portfolio], [resume], [Dark Mode][darkm], and customizeable cookie banners.

The table below shows what's included in each version:

## Troubleshooting
I can help you set up the theme and answer any questions you might have, billed hourly at [**$125/h**](https://app.simplegoods.co/i/UDMGHRSG). Buyers of the *PRO+ version* get an hour of free support and pay **$100/h** afterwards. Rates are subject to change depending on demand, but buyers of PRO+ will always get a 20% discount.

Since I've built Hydejack, it's fair to say that I'm the world's expert on troubleshooting Hydejack. I'm also familiar with related technologies such as Jekyll, Netlify, git, GitHub Pages, and the web stack in gerneral, so you'll get good value for your money.
